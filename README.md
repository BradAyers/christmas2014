Christmas card to family and friends

This page is hosted and can be found at http://www.bradayers.com/christmas/2014/.  I have been sending out an annual Christmas card and this is my most recent.  I used HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript in the coding.  Some of the code could be condensed, especially some of the scripting.  Since I was sending this to family and friends, I did not condense the code as much as I would have liked since I needed to send it by the end of November 2014 so that the recipients could use all of my advent calendar.  My plan is to begin work on the 2015 version soon, push it to GitHub, and have better condensed code.  Please feel free to offer any suggestions for improvements.
