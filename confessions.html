                            As I reflect on nearly fifty years of Christmases, I realize that some of my most enduring memories were tearful ones.  Those instances when one recognizes the true meaning of this blessed time of year and the emotion of the moment simply cannot be contained.  Both occurred during my teenage years.  One with a group of strangers and the other with my family that is so dear to me.

                            During one year a friend and I had started a “Rent-A-Santa” business delivering presents to our customers.  One particularly memorable evening, my dad drove me (Santa) to a home on Evergreen Street in Boulder.  The parents had left a few presents on the front porch for Santa to deliver to their two children.  Upon entering their home, I could see from their modest surroundings that mom and dad must have spent what little they had to provide them a special Christmas surprise.  After the standard “ho-ho-ho” and presentation of their gifts, the little boy and girl politely took their leave and promptly returned, each with a toy of their own in their hand.  With smiles on their faces, they insisted that Santa accept their gift.  As I left the warmth of their home and got back in dad’s truck, he noted the tear in my eye and asked me what had happened.  As I shared the story with him, I realized the lesson those two beautiful children had so recently taught me.  Just as God gave us the gift of Jesus on Christmas day, our real joy in life is to be found in the giving.  I treasure their gift of that lesson to this day.

                            The other memory that stands out for me is one evening when mom, dad and my sisters were decorating the house for Christmas.  The living room was strewn with half unpacked boxes, holiday music in the background and the expectant joy that accompanies the preparation for another holiday season.  As mom reached into a box, she produced a little hand-made decoration with a tear and fondly recollected the recently departed loved one who had given her this beloved holiday memento just a few Christmases ago.  We all gathered around mom and fondly reminisced about all the joy our aunt had brought into our lives.  Her gift to us that night, and every day thereafter, were the cherished moments that we had shared and the memories that had been indelibly etched in our hearts.

                            As you and your loved ones celebrate the gift of another Christmas season together, I wish you love, happiness and the gift of many beloved Christmas memories that will endure through the years to come.  God bless and Merry Christmas.
